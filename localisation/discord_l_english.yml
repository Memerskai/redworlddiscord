 DIS_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Red World, founded by Kaiser1871 after lengthy government restructuring, has stood as a beacon of the HOI4 Modding Cooperative, an alliance formed out of the ashes of Australia. Kaiser has ruled for decades, creating the Commissariat and the Thot Patrol to advise him. But in recent years, his advisors have become leftists, and right-wing residents have become more and more alienated. Conservative and nationalist forces have rallied under the banner of the Nationalist No-Role Party, and the fascist underground only grows stronger. One spark could set the whole nation aflame."

Among those gathered were Otto, former Thot Patroller and one of the most prominent Catholics of Red World. The Sermon was proceeding as usual until Communion, when a deacon was pouring Otto some altar wine. Unfortunately, Otto didn't swallow it properly and ended up choking to death in front of the whole congregation. The sermon was promptly cancelled and Otto carried away."

Shortly after the messages were intercepted, Flacsa and major NNRP officials evacuated the country and boarded a plane for Darwinreich. Gindisi is unlikely to allow us to send anyone into bring them back for imprisonment, as they are now under foreign amnesty. We suspect that Flacsa has joined up with Moon, who had already fled the country during the Second Battle of Brisbane. Unfortunately for the NNRP, they are unlikely to gain any more political power, and will eventually fade into obscurity. Right?"

 discord_flavor.204.t:0 "The Plane Crash"
 discord_flavor.204.d:0 "Jair Bolsonaro boarded his private jet and prepared to fly to Russia with a military entourage to personally asssassinate dissidents Owlie and Tactimacti in their home in Vladivostok, where they had been printing anti-Bolsonaro and anti-government propaganda under pseudounyms. Owlie and Tacti had been able to rally a significant amount of anti-Bolsonaro resistance, such as a particulary violent riot in the former Submod Territory, in which political dissidents organized a mass protest against the Bolsonaro government.\n\nBolsonaro's plane flew over Japan in the dead of night, when suddenly, the pilot announced the plane was going down. The passengers panicked - was this some kind of trick of the exiles, or was this just an accident? Some even thought the pilot himself was a spy for anti-government organizations, and manuevered his plane in a kamikaze manuever.\n\nPilot Shumel, one of the few jews Bolsonaro spared during the revolution, was honored by Bolsonaro by being given the right to fly the plane. Perhaps this was Bolsonaro's greatest mistake, as Shumel's far right Jewish nationalist group began to open fire on those who were trying to brace for impact, and Shumel himself kamikazed the plane over Takoka. According to the few survivors from the Jewish nationalist group, he uttered "Long Live The Thot Patrol! Long Live Socialism!" before finally destroying the plane in a burst of flame.\n\nNo one knows what the coming days will bring, but Bolsonaro's successor Chancellor has already been sworn in, and it is likely whatever is left of the opposition will mobilize against Bolsonaro. Anarchists, NNRP members, even those loyal to the Thot Patrol who still remain in Red World, will fight in the final battle. The fascist regime may not have long left."

 discord_flavor.250.d:0 "In an event that has now been dubbed "The Siege of Mount Isa", our army underwent a week-long seige of a compound held by Crusade and many other NNRP and social nationalist dissidents, including prominent NNRP economist Jack Hoxha. Hoxha, sensing that Bolsonaro would betray the group, organized the building of a massive bunker inside a large compound, along with a large stockpile of assault weapons. Under the conditions led out in the "Security of Red World Act", the government was able to march on the compound days after the act was passed. However, the NNRP members stationed there did not go down without a fight. When more than 70 federal agents attacked the compound, a gun battle began with NNRP paramilitaries, who successfully shot one federal agent dead before retreating back into the compound. Realizing another attack would lead to even more losses, federal forces began to cut water and power sources to the compound, forcing the NNRP to survive on bottled water and rations. 5 days after the initial assault, Jair Bolsonaro gave a direct order to mount an assault, sending multiple armored vehicles and troopers into the compound. Armored vehicles blew holes into the compound as forces pumped in tear gas into the compound. When a federal agent was shot dead in the compound, Bolsonaro's forces retaliated with ramping up tear gas usage. Crusade, realizing he had little time left, gave a direct order to set fire to the entire compound. None survived. Crusade was found dead in the compound with shotgun wounds to the head, while Jack Hoxha's pose was consistent with cyanide poisoning. Unfortunately, the fire claimed the lives of numerous agents searching the building, and public backlash from relatives has been striking."

 discord_flavor.1.t:0 "A Day in Debates"
 discord_flavor.1.d:0 "Voices echoed through the room as the commissars called the debate session to order. Mr. Quartz, founder of the Cromwellian Protestant Socialist movement and subject of much mockery from the regulars of debates, was facing off against Twiggierjet, debates legend closely associated with the Socialist Front, a group of no-role socialists and social democrats, and the American Patriot, a debates newcomer who had quickly established himself as an enemy to the usual crowd of debates.. 'Everything must Serve the State, and in return, the State aids the Citizenry on the Gilded Path,' Quartz said matter-of-factly, Patriot responding with references to the American Bill of Rights. However, this weak appeal to a code of laws that wasn't relevant to Quartz's ideology soon fizzled. When Quartz began to speak again about the gilded ideology of the state and the future of his new country, Twiggierjet responded with 'Quartz, you are in no position to talk of glorious futures when your entire ideology is devoted to keeping humanity in stagnation in the name of order and creepy rural romanticism.' Quartz responded by claiming that his beilefs were anything but creepy, attacking the concept of the modern urban lifestyle and condemning progressive ideals. Patriot quickly left the discussion, but Twiggierjet and Cyloxia continued to debate Quartz's beliefs. When Twiggierjet compared Quartz's ideology to 'The Burgundian System' from popular alternate-history game The New Order, Quartz laughed it off. 'But they're Nazis. Nazis are agents of the Anti-State. How could they want a system like I propose?' Quartz was then attacked for his belief that a lord protector would be uncorruptable, but this debate soon fizzled out. An hour later, the debate resumed. Twiggierjet cleverly pushed Quartz into revealing the people that influenced his ideology - people like Evola and Pelley. Does Quartz renounce his ideology on this day? Or does his resolve only grow stronger?  "

But he was weak compared to the Lord Protector. He was not prepared for the Storm - the Abyss - that cut him down and drove his country into destruction. He did not purge the Traitors, the Anarchists, the Fascists, the Terrorists, but we will. A prominent political protest, planned for months by the Anti-Statists - The March for Democracy, was the perfect target to show the Terrorists what happens to those who oppose the will of CromProtSoc. Led by Shepard, they marched throughout the streets of Brisbane - waving their petty protest signs, calling for such pathetic notions as Democracy and Capitalism. Our glorious army, the militia of the state, crushed them. They left none of them alive, their bodies piling up on our streets as a warning to those who betray Quartz. Their leader, Shepard, now lies in an unmarked grave. He does not deserve the dignity of a fair burial."

While many members of the commissariat thought that Al would centralize power in favor of a dictatorship with benevolent characteristics, Al has surprised the people, and caved into the reformists. There are many parties who have announced their candidacy in the new election, such as the Commissar Unity Coalition, built on Kaiserist values, mutual unity, and political centrism. Al and Pheonix have established the Socialist Front, along with the backing of prominent no-roles Macklaus, Twiggierjet, and Rob!. A third party, however, the Monarcho-Syndicalist Party, has also annocuned their candidacy, swaying many anarchists and revolutionary socialists to their cause. However, since most anarchists are banned from running for office, they have united under the odd beliefs of Jester, who supports a socialist monarchy."

The commissars, who once reigned over the land of Red World from their opulent homes in Brisbane, have now been relegated to what amounts to a british lord, figurative titles that occupy the upper branch of the legislature. With the new no-role democracy, a two-house legislature was established, with the House of No-Roles and the House of the Commissars being created. The No-Role parties differ greatly from those of the commissars - the Socialist Front and the Catholic Bolsheviks still stay intact under Gerbbro, Macklaus, and Twiggierjet, but the CUC and the Monarcho-Syndicalist Party have been completely disbanded, leaving a power vacuum for the centrists and the revolutionary socialists. In there place, lies the Nationalist No-Role Party, a big-tent party of prominent nationalists and conservatives, led by the prominent anti-commissar Crusade. In the center, the Social Democratic Party has risen, led by Shepard and MGM. It espouses liberal values, social democracy, and globalism."

Al's words were met with scorn by the majority of the populace, but they had no influence in government, so their words were not heard. The new democracy of the commissariat would feature elections, of course, but the only candidates would be commissars. Because of this, there would be no possible way to allow for a no-role democracy, unless, of course, a reformist commissar was to come into power and create a democracy of the no-roles. The move was applauded by most commissars, and while some had small displeasures at the faux democracy they had created, others were convinced that this new regime would still be democractic - there were still elections, for candidates of varying ideologies. The NNRP and SDP were quick to denounce the move, and Shepard threatened the commissars with a warning that he would lead a march on Brisbane with loyal commissars. 'He's a slacktivist,' responded Al, 'A neolibtard. It's not like he will actually do anything.'"

Moon's political career has been associated with a major scandal involving the use of a racial slur in a debate, which promptly got him banned from participating in public debates by the Thot Patrol. Crusade supporters argue that Moon's status of being banned from debates makes him a particullary inifficient candidate, yet Moon supporters argue that his status as a pink-name, a derogatory word for people who are banned from debates, only makes him more of a martyr to the cause of the party."

However, with the ousting of Al in favor of a no-role democracy, the seat is up for grabs. There are many candidates for the election - both Macklaus and Twiggierjet are debates veterans.

The candidates - prominent prgamatic progressive Shepard, and controversial social democrat MGM. MGM was famously known for being a former DixBol, an ideology that promoted Dixie nationalism along with socialism. However, he has considerably shifted to moderate positions since then, becoming a social democrat. MGM also was wracked with a recent scandal where he told NNRP moderate Nabe to kill himself for using Wikipedia as a source in a debate. Unfortunately, this has led establishment social democrats and neoliberals to condemn MGM, but that doesn't stop him from posing a secure challenge to the reign of Shepard. Shepard's tenure as leader of the party has been marked with constant opposition to the government, but also pragmatic policies that appeal to the commissars. Because of this, he has been labeled a 'neocon' for his pragmatism, although he responds time and time again with the fact that he supports progressive issues."

MGM has cited the fact that the Socialist Front and CBP existed long before the establishing of a democracy in Red World, and that they would be perfectly fine with overturning such a democracy to suit their own nefarious needs. Former leader Shepard, when this proposal reached his office, called it 'a disgusting proposal, and everything that a true progressive should oppose.' Despite opposition from Shepard, who MGM has condemned as a neo-con sympathizer, he has gone forward with the proposal, sending a proposal to the party leader of the nationalists. At the end, the nationalists have two choices... What will be the fate of this proposal?"

Gerbbro is certainly more progressive compared to the hardliners of Otto and Oskar, though he runs unopposed from other hardliners, being the only candidate for the party.

The party's major leaders today include commissars Gerronuma, Zerial, and ImperialCaesar, who all support centrist policies. However, each one has also been criticized for their quirks and oddities. Gerronuma has been slandered for 'having his head in the clouds', and investigations into commissar activity found him to have a large stash of innapropriate material on his computer. However, he is known as an apolitical candidate, something that may unite the nation in these times of trouble. The other candidate, Caesar, has been accused of wanting to restore a Kaiserist monarchy under the guise of a New Roman Empire.

Legochiel expressed his desire to keep the nation in accordance with the principles of the great leader Kaiser - the economy would stay mixed, but not socialist like many want it to be, and no new nationalizations would be done. Christianity would return to the forefront, and local elections would be held - although the parliament would be mostly controlled by Legochiel. A new dawn for Red World has truly begun, one with more legitimacy than any Commissar or even Thot Patrol government."

In recent years, however, it had begun to openly plot against Kaiser, and with the Thot Patrol not revealing Kaiser's will and the anarchists attempting a coup, it is obvious that we cannot trust this repugnant institution any longer. Legochiel had previously reshuffled the commissariat to kick out many of the remaining socialists, but now, it is completely abolished. No longer will the commissariat hold any sway over the land of Red World. All important information will either be relayed to the Thot Patrol, or to the people.

With Runtime brought to justice, and executed by our glorious Kaiser Legochiel, we can now release the Pax Pacifica hotfix in all its glory, giving words to Cascadia and UAPR events.

I wouldn't trust Legochiel enough for me to comfortably stay in this nation."

He was going to shoot to kill, whatever it took, to secure his place in the annals of history against his leftist claimant. Wilf looked nervous, her eyes darting around at the crowd and Legochiel. After a few tense minutes, Wilf regained her composure, and the duel began. They walked backwards 20 paces, gazing at eachother with iron glares. These comrades who had once been staunch allies of Kaiser were now ready to fight to the death, to kill the other in combat.\n\nThe signal blared. Before Wilf could even get a chance to respond, Legochiel drew his gun and shot right through her heart with pinpoint accuracy. He wiped his brow with a hankerchief and walked back to the palace, Wilf lying dead on the ground behind him. Legochiel may have challenged his friend to a duel to the death, but he was not about to mutilate her corpse like a villain.\n\n After the duel, Legochiel arranged for Wilf's body to be taken and buried in a lavish graveyard down the street from Kaiser Legochiel's palace, next to Kaiser1871 himself.

Leftist candidate Tactimacti, who has run under the banner of the Communist Party of Red World but promises a grand socialist political coalition, has garnered much support from socialist commissars. Two socialist commissars and independent members of the Commissariat TheWolfFate and Blackmesa have endorsed Tacti, with Blackmesa’s endorsement being particularly shocking given his admiration for Wilfred Laurier, another main candidate in the election. Reporter Comrade Athos from the prominent socialist magazine “Vox Populi” interviewed Blackmesa shortly after his endorsement of Tactimacti. “I would love to support my dearest friend Wilf, but the truth is, what Red World needs is a party that will build socialism, freedom, and peace, and I have full confidence in the ability of Tactimacti to do such a thing,” said Blackmesa. However, other commissars associated with the Anarchist Coalition of Commissars have declined to choose a candidate yet, scheduling a party conference later in the month. But the question remains - will Tacti be able to sway enough socialists to her cause to secure a victory over the two other socialist candidates, Wilf and Otto, and prominent populist Owlie?"

Ben had been a member of the commissariat for a long time, but eventually, his activity in legislative circles declined, and he only attended commissariat meetings once in a while.

Owile has also been endorsed by numerous no-role groups, including the Shepard-led Democratic Party.

Some advocate for a monarchy where Wilf can choose his successor himself, not bending to any Thot Patroller or Commissar. This could be his children or family, or a trusted commissar.

The event will be highly televized and filled with with propaganda, with minute-long ads interspersed between tense moments, all advertising the joining of the Alist Party and instructing them to report any suspected liberals to the police. The 24 politicans who were chosen by Al were forced into a sprawling arena, where they will be trained in the art of combat for days before they are forced into combat with their fellow politicians.

This million-dollar event has truly shown the people the true power of our eternal Comrade, and will act as a warning signal to any remaining liberals. In the beginning of the event, Liberals fell left and right, and blood stained the floor of the Arena to Combat Liberalism. However, the Liberals eventually were able to use basic survival skills to hold out in groups, until they were slowly picked off by more agressive groups of Liberals. As the games reached their end, clear favorites such as the conservative duo of Legochiel and Ben, were taken out by a united gang of moderate socialists, who eventually turned on eachother after killing Legochiel. In an unexpected move, Macklaus betrayed the other moderate socialists and gave away their location to Rain and die192, who represented the Anarchist Coalition of Commissars. After a chilling battle that saw Hammy, Twiggierjet, and die192 die, Rain and Macklaus emerged as the winning contestants. Professing their eternal love to eachother, they threatened Al with a double suicide. But Al cared more about facts than feelings, and so he did not care one bit for their touching act, and they were promply murdered as the ground opened under them and they fell far into Hell, where they hopefully will stay forever. Al has announced that the Libtard Games will continue each year, and praised the Games as a great success for the Alite cause."

Even pacifists such as Zandrax voted in favor of the resolution, and Jair Bolsonaro was brought to the town square to be ceremoniously executed. With Jair Bolsonaro brought upon the guillotine like the kings of old, Tacti herself arrived on the scene to give a rousing speech about the great evil of fascism. She regaled the audience of tales of her banning of spammers years before, and now, she was just about to destroy the source. Tacti walked up to the guillotine herself and prepared for the execution as the people cheered and screamed in the crowds, hungry for blood and hungry for vengeance. In an instant, the blade sliced through him, and cries of joy echoed throughout the town square. The guerilla campaign of Jair Bolsonaro, the self-exiled revolutionary, was over. To the communists, it marked a day of glory and rejoice, and for the remaining fascists, it was a warning to any who dare to stand against the benevolent regime of Tactimacti and her lefist comrades."

With this list of demands, the Brocialist faction has been forced to either concede to the CPRW's 14 demands or face expulsion from the party.

This culminated in a visit to the factory, where both Comrades Tacti and Merox went on a tour around the facility together. During their two-hour visit they saw the brand new production lines, met with both the factory manager as well as numerous workers and talked with them about both the new plant and the hopes and aspirations they had for it. In spite of the widespread expectations that Comrades Tacti and Merox would be tense in the aftermath of the case of the 14 Points, that proved to not be the case, as the two seemed quite friendly towards each other the entire visit through. At the end of the visit, they held a speech to the workers in the cafeteria together without even the smallest sign of conflict between the two.

If the Brocialists lost, Tacti would have to surrender to power to a candidate like Zandrax who would unite the nation and keep Tactiist values secure.

But then, months after the rumours began circulating, Mr. Quartz gave a surprise, televised announcement to the Grand Parliament. He laid out the establishment of a new branch of the government, completely out of the blue, known as the Strixes State Security Service, or just the Strixes for short. A special branch of the already secretive Commonwealth Intelligence Community, the Strixes would be tasked with hunting down anyone who would pose an existential threat to the CromProtSoc cause - even if those threats were harboured in the sacred institution of the Grand Parliament.

The three positions opened after the sacking of three inactive commissars have ended in gains for Kaiserist, CathBol, and Socialist factions, shifting a turn left in the political climate of Red World. Oskar himself is a part of the ever-growing Catholic Bolshevik movement, which promotes distributist economics along with a state built on traditional and religious values. While it initially gained popularity due to the position of Otto of Red World, Oskar had been advocating for catholic bolshevism for a long time - perhaps even longer than Otto. Oskar joined the Kingdom of Red World's political landscape earlier than most, and he is one of the oldest, consistently contributing members of the political scene. Oskar is also the governor of Blue World, an ever-growing region of the Kingdom of Red World that has birthed a strong catholic following, with figures such as Legochiel prominent there. Denied the role of commissar for many years, Oskar was finally able to secure the nomination, with even the Anarchists nominating him for commissar. Oskar had been denied commissar for two reasons - a personal dislike of him by Kaiser1871, and the role of the Anarchist Coalition of Commissars and their progressive allies - who distrusted Oskar's traditional theories. However, against all odds, Oskar has become commissar. What this does for the political landscape remains to be seen, but it will certainly strengthen the position of the already powerful Catholic Bolsheviks."

Chomskyphile is known to be simpathetic toward the NNRP and no-roles in general, and it is unknown whether he will follow further government commandments, even if Crusade is participating in inappropriate actions. While Crusade still leads the NNRP from within the Submod Territory, his influence in local politics has been diminished. However, with his connections to many popular movements and the nation of Darwinreich, along with the drama server active in Cold War: Iron Curtain, it is certain that the name Crusade will not be forgotten. Crusade refused to comment on the issue to the media, who he referred to as, "government puppets who would twist my words to seek their elitist agenda" but it is assumed that it has not shaken him too much. Crusade has always been an unpopular figure with the Thot Patrol, and this may even increase his popular support."
